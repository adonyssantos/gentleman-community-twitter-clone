### Atomic Design Approach

The Atomic Design methodology involves the following steps:

1. **Atoms**: Design and define the smallest UI elements, such as buttons, form fields, icons, and typography styles.
2. **Molecules**: Atoms are combined to create more complex components that fulfill specific functions, such as a search bar or navigation menu.
3. **Organisms**: Organisms build larger-scale components by combining molecules and atoms. These organisms represent complete sections of the website, such as a header or footer.
4. **Templates**: Finally, organisms are combined to create complete web page layouts that can be reused across the website. Templates provide a consistent structure and visual coherence.
