# How to contribute?

## We use Conventional Commits!

[![Conventional Commits](https://img.shields.io/badge/Conventional%20Commits-1.0.0-%23FE5196?logo=conventionalcommits&logoColor=white)](https://conventionalcommits.org)

Conventional Commits is the specification we use to write semantically valuable commits.

### Syntax

```text
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
```

- `type`: The type of your commit.
- `scope`: The scope that is affected by your commit.
- `subject`: A brief description of the work done in your commit.

#### Supported types

- `feat`
- `style`
- `test`
- `docs`
- `chore`
- `ci`
- `build`
- `perf`

#### Supported scopes

- `root`
- `mobile`
- `web`
- `client`
- `server`
- `shared`
- `types`

Samples:
```text
feat(server): add prisma client
```

```text
fear(shared): add log in component
```

```text
fix(web): fix typo on hero text
```
